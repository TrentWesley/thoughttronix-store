    ``checkout_data`` is the ``cleaned_data`` of a valid ``CheckoutForm``.
    Addresses and line prices are denormalized onto the order — an order
    is a snapshot, immune to later catalog or address edits. Of the card,
    only the last four digits are stored; the full number and CVV never
    touch the database.

    ``coupon_code``, if given, is redeemed here — inside the transaction,
    so this is the check that counts, however long ago the customer
    previewed it. The coupon's code and the per-line discounts it gave
    are snapshotted onto the order and its items.

    All-or-nothing: runs in a transaction, so a failure partway through
    leaves no partial order and the cart intact.

    Raises ``ValueError`` if the cart is empty or holds a product that is
    no longer available, and its subclass ``CouponError`` (with a message
    fit for the customer) if the coupon can't be used on this cart.
